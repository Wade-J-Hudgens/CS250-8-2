## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User stories help with this by having details on what we want a specific feature to do. The developers do not have to worry about getting the details from the customer, unless they need clarification on them.
## How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When you first start developing programs, you need to consider the size of a team to decide what developmental process you want to use. I hope to learn other different digital team boards in the future.
## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Communication is the most important aspect of agile development. You can write amazing code, but not get the feature right because you did not understand the user story.
